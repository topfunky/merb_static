merb_static
===========

A plugin for the Merb framework that generates static HTML (and other) files from a dynamic Merb application.

Provides functionality similar to static-site building tools like Webby, but you can use all the plugins, helpers, and databases available to Merb.

For example, I use Mac OS X to generate screenshots for a news-reading application, but deploy to a Linux box hosted at RailsMachine. I can use merb_static to generate the HTML locally and deploy the static files and images to the server.

Usage
=====

In config/dependencies.rb:

  dependency "merb_static"
  
Add other configuration information (TODO).

  * TODO

Generate the site:

  rake merb_static:build
  
Start over:

  rake merb_static:clean
  
Build and deploy to a remote server:

  rake merb_static:sync

You may want to run your own app's tasks first by creating a custom Rake task:

  task :my_sync => [:my_build_task, "merb_static:sync"]
